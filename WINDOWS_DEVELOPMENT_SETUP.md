# Windows Development Environment Setup & Solutions

## Issues Identified

### 1. Node.js PATH Issue
**Problem**: NPM commands couldn't find installed packages (next, tsc, etc.) even after successful `npm install`.

**Root Cause**: While `node_modules/.bin` directory exists with proper .cmd files, the Windows environment can't execute them due to Node.js not being in the PATH when called from npm scripts.

**Evidence**:
- `node_modules/.bin` directory exists and contains proper .cmd files
- Direct execution with full Node.js path works: `"C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" "node_modules\next\dist\bin\next"`
- npx and npm scripts fail because they can't locate the `node` executable

### 2. Build Process Issues
**Problem**: Next.js build fails with webpack/undici compatibility error.

**Error Details**:
```
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (682:63)
File was processed with these loaders:
 * ./node_modules/next/dist/build/webpack/loaders/next-flight-client-module-loader.js
 * ./node_modules/next/dist/build/webpack/loaders/next-swc-loader.js
You may need an additional loader to handle the result of these loaders.
```

**Root Cause**: Compatibility issue between undici package (used by Firebase Auth) and Next.js 14.1.0 webpack configuration.

### 3. ESLint Configuration Missing
**Problem**: Project has no ESLint configuration file.

**Status**: ESLint is installed but no `.eslintrc.*` file exists in the project root.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Custom Development Tools Script
Created `dev-tools.bat` script that provides Windows-compatible access to all development tools:

**Usage**:
```batch
dev-tools.bat dev               # Start development server
dev-tools.bat build             # Build production bundle
dev-tools.bat type-check        # Run TypeScript type checking
dev-tools.bat next [args]       # Run Next.js CLI
dev-tools.bat tsc [args]        # Run TypeScript compiler
dev-tools.bat eslint [args]     # Run ESLint
```

**Features**:
- Uses full path to Node.js executable
- Bypasses PATH issues
- Provides simple command interface
- Supports all common development tasks

### 2. Direct Command Execution
For immediate use, commands can be run directly:

```batch
# TypeScript type checking
"C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" "node_modules\typescript\lib\tsc.js" --noEmit

# Next.js development server
"C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" "node_modules\next\dist\bin\next" dev

# Next.js build
"C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" "node_modules\next\dist\bin\next" build
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- TypeScript type checking (no errors found)
- Development tools script
- Direct command execution
- Node.js and npm are properly installed

### ❌ Not Working
- Next.js production build (undici/webpack error)
- Standard npx commands
- ESLint (missing configuration)

### ⚠️ Workarounds Available
- Use `dev-tools.bat` for all development tasks
- Use direct Node.js execution for specific commands

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Build Error**: Research undici/webpack compatibility issue
   - May require updating Firebase dependencies
   - Could need Next.js upgrade or webpack configuration changes

2. **ESLint Setup**: Configure ESLint for the project
   - Run `dev-tools.bat next lint` to initialize Next.js ESLint config
   - Or manually create `.eslintrc.json`

3. **Environment Variables**: Check if any environment setup is missing
   - Verify all required .env files exist
   - Ensure Firebase and Stripe keys are configured

## Development Workflow

For now, use the custom `dev-tools.bat` script for all development tasks:

```batch
# Start development
dev-tools.bat dev

# Type check before committing
dev-tools.bat type-check

# Build (will fail until undici issue is resolved)
dev-tools.bat build
```

This provides a working development environment while the underlying PATH and build issues are resolved.
