  - **Description**: Chart component uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML with dynamic content generation.
  - **File**: `components/ui/chart.tsx`
  - **Details**: Lines 81-98 use dangerouslySetInnerHTML to inject dynamic CSS. While the data appears to be from controlled sources (THEMES object and config), this pattern is inherently risky and needs validation.
  - **Connected Files**: Any component using ChartConfig (Note: component not currently used in app)
  - **Execution Status**: `SECURITY ANALYSIS`
  - **Execution Log / Error**: N/A - Security pattern identified during code review
  - **Remediation Plan**: Analyze data flow to confirm safety or implement safer CSS injection method.
  - **Resolution**: ✅ Added input sanitization with regex validation to prevent XSS attacks. Color values are now validated against safe character patterns before injection.

- [x] **(CRITICAL) AUDIT: Missing Essential Configuration Files**

- [x] **(CRITICAL) AUDIT: Invalid Dependencies - Package Installation Failure**
  - **Description**: npm install fails due to non-existent package @radix-ui/react-sheet in package.json.
  - **File**: `package.json`
  - **Details**: The package @radix-ui/react-sheet@^1.0.4 does not exist in npm registry, causing complete installation failure.
  - **Connected Files**: All files that depend on node_modules
  - **Execution Status**: `FAILURE`
  - **Execution Log / Error**:

    ```txt
    npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@radix-ui%2freact-sheet - Not found
    npm error 404  '@radix-ui/react-sheet@^1.0.4' is not in this registry.
    ```

  - **Remediation Plan**: Remove invalid dependency and replace with correct Radix UI dialog/sheet component.
  - **Resolution**: ✅ Removed invalid @radix-ui/react-sheet dependency from package.json. The sheet component correctly uses @radix-ui/react-dialog which is already included.
  - **Description**: Core Next.js project configuration files are missing, preventing the application from running.
  - **File**: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`
  - **Details**: The project lacks fundamental configuration files required for a Next.js application. Without these, the project cannot be built, tested, or run.
  - **Connected Files**: All project files depend on these configurations
  - **Execution Status**: `STATIC ANALYSIS`
  - **Execution Log / Error**: N/A - Files not found during directory scanning
  - **Remediation Plan**: Create all missing configuration files based on the project structure and dependencies used in the codebase.

- [x] **(HIGH) AUDIT: Type Mismatch - Firebase Client vs Admin SDK**
  - **Description**: AI flow passes firebase-admin instance to function expecting client-side firebase instance.
  - **File**: `ai/flows/ai-chat-guidance.ts`
  - **Details**: Line 26 passes firestoreAdmin to getAvailability function which expects Firestore client instance, causing type mismatch and potential runtime errors.
  - **Connected Files**: `services/firestore.ts`, `lib/firebase-admin.ts`
  - **Execution Status**: `STATIC ANALYSIS`
  - **Execution Log / Error**: N/A - Type incompatibility identified during function signature analysis
  - **Remediation Plan**: Create separate admin version of getAvailability function or modify the client function to handle both types.
  - **Resolution**: ✅ Created admin version of getAvailability function in firestore-admin.ts and updated AI flow to use the correct import. Type mismatch resolved.

- [x] **(HIGH) AUDIT: Type System - Incorrect Firebase Admin Import**
  - **Description**: types.ts imports from firebase-admin instead of client-side firebase, causing potential TypeScript compilation issues.
  - **File**: `lib/types.ts`
  - **Details**: Line 3 imports Timestamp from 'firebase-admin/firestore' but the type is unused and causes issues in client-side builds.
  - **Connected Files**: Any component that imports from lib/types.ts
  - **Execution Status**: `STATIC ANALYSIS`
  - **Execution Log / Error**: N/A - Import inconsistency identified during type analysis
  - **Remediation Plan**: Remove unused firebase-admin import from types.ts.
  - **Resolution**: ✅ Removed unused firebase-admin import from types.ts. This eliminates client-side build conflicts with server-side Firebase packages.

- [x] **(HIGH) AUDIT: Security - Hardcoded API Keys**
  - **Description**: Firebase API keys and configuration are hardcoded in source code instead of using environment variables.
  - **File**: `lib/firebase.ts`
  - **Details**: Firebase configuration contains sensitive API keys directly in the code (lines 8-15). This is a security risk and prevents different configurations for dev/prod environments.
  - **Connected Files**: All components and services using Firebase authentication
  - **Execution Status**: `STATIC ANALYSIS`  
  - **Execution Log / Error**: N/A - Security vulnerability identified during code review
  - **Remediation Plan**: Move Firebase configuration to environment variables and update the configuration to use process.env values.
