## 🚨 **CRITICAL BUGS IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

### **1. Build System Failures (RESOLVED ✅)**

**Issue**: Application completely unable to build

```
❌ Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-hook-form'
❌ Module not found: Can't resolve '@hookform/resolvers/zod'  
❌ Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-day-picker'
❌ Module not found: Can't resolve 'firebase-admin'
```

**Root Cause**: Missing essential dependencies in package.json
**Impact**: 100% build failure - no development or deployment possible
**Resolution**: ✅ Added all missing dependencies to package.json

### **2. Syntax Error in AI Flow (RESOLVED ✅)**

**Issue**: JavaScript syntax error preventing compilation

```
❌ Unterminated string constant at ai/flows/ai-chat-guidance.ts:97
❌ Expected ',', got 'string literal'
```

**Root Cause**: Malformed template literal with incorrect newline handling
**Impact**: Build failure in AI chat functionality  
**Resolution**: ✅ Fixed template literal syntax with proper escaping

### **3. Next.js Configuration Issue (RESOLVED ✅)**

**Issue**: Deprecated configuration option

```
⚠️ Invalid next.config.js options detected: Unrecognized key 'appDir'
```

**Root Cause**: Using deprecated `experimental.appDir` in Next.js 14
**Impact**: Build warnings and potential future compatibility issues
**Resolution**: ✅ Removed deprecated option from configuration

### **4. Environment Setup Missing (RESOLVED ✅)**

**Issue**: No environment variables configuration
**Root Cause**: Missing `.env.local` file for local development
**Impact**: Firebase, Stripe, and AI services non-functional
**Resolution**: ✅ Created comprehensive environment template with all required variables
